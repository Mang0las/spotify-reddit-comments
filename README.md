The goal of this application is to learn about how to use APIs, more specifically Spotify and Reddit ones.

It will:
1.  Scan a Spotify playlist for names of all the artists.
2.  Scan a Reddit topic and find any comments that include a name of one of the artists.
3.  Returns the results in a (semi) formatted html file with hyperlinks.
